# Psychic-Game

In this project we are using mainly using javascript to create a guessing game.

The computer will chose a letter in the alphabet and you as the player have 9 guesses to to guess the letter that the computer has already chosen.

The wins, losses, guesses total, guesses left, and current guesses will all dynamically be recorded on the webpage as the game is played.
